    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The name tiramisù comes from the Italian tiramisù, meaning “pick me up” or
      “cheer me up.” And that’s the perfect way to describe this rich and
      decadent Italian dessert. Some records state that Tiramisù originated in
      Treviso, Italy in 1800, but other records state that it originated from an
      idea by pastry chef Loly Linguanotto in the late 1960’s. Even though its
      exact origins have been debated, what we know for sure is that you’re
      going to love it.

    <p>
      Tiramisu is an elegant and rich layered Italian dessert made with delicate
      ladyfinger cookies, espresso or instant espresso, mascarpone cheese, eggs,
      sugar, Marsala wine, rum and cocoa powder. Through the grouping of these
      diverse ingredients, an intense yet refined dish emerges. The delicate
      flavor of layers of mascarpone and Italian custard are contrasted with the
      darkly robust presence of espresso and sharpness of cocoa powder. The name
      itself, tiramisu, means “pick me up” in Italian most likely referring to
      the two caffeinated ingredients that are present in the dish, espresso and
      cocoa.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the cream</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4large egg yolks</li>
      <li>½cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided</li>
      <li>¾cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the assembly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1¾cups good espresso or very strong coffee</li>
      <li>2tablespoons rum or cognac</li>
      <li>2tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package)</li>
      <li>1 to 2ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the cream: Using an electric mixer in a large bowl, whip
        together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and
        about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters
        (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it
        creates soft peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates
        a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone
        mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the assembly, combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch
        dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon
        cocoa powder.

      <li>
        Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso
        mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the
        liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the
        baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an
        even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any
        obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). Spread half the
        mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with
        remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Cover with
        plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if
        you can wait 24 hours, all the better). Top with shaved or finely grated
        chocolate, if desired, then slice or scoop to serve.
