    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Cheesecake is a beloved dessert around the world. While many assume that
      it has its origins in New York, it actually dates back much further. Let's
      go back over 4,000 years to ancient Greece! Sit back, grab a creamy slice
      of cheesecake and learn all about this dessert’s rich history.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each region of the world also has its own take on the best way to make the
      dessert. Italians use ricotta cheese, while the Greeks use mizithra or
      feta. Germans prefer cottage cheese, while the Japanese use a combination
      of cornstarch and egg whites. There are specialty cheesecakes that include
      blue cheese, seafood, spicy chilies and even tofu! In spite of all the
      variations, the popular dessert’s main ingredients – cheese, wheat and a
      sweetener –remain the same.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100g butter</li>
      <li>250g digestive biscuits, crushed into fine crumbs</li>
      <li>500g full-fat soft cheese</li>
      <li>100g icing sugar</li>
      <li>237g crunchy peanut butter</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>300ml double cream</li>
      <li>4 cubes raspberry jelly, chopped into smaller chunks</li>
      <li>200g frozen raspberries, defrosted</li>
      <li>1 tbsp caster sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>
        Line an 18-20cm square baking tin with a strip of baking parchment,
        leaving the ends overhanging – this will help you lift the cheesecake
        out later. Put the butter in a large heatproof bowl that has a wide lip
        and set over a smaller heatproof bowl filled with boiling water from the
        kettle. Leave to stand for a minute, then stir until completely smooth.
        Stir in the crushed biscuits, then spoon the mixture into the prepared
        tin, pressing it down using the back of a spoon.
      </li>

        Beat the soft cheese, icing sugar, peanut butter and vanilla together in
        a bowl until well combined. Whisk the double cream in a separate bowl
        until it’s just holding its shape. Gently fold this into the peanut
        butter mixture, then spread over the biscuit base and smooth the surface
        using the back of a spoon. Chill for at least 1 hr to set. Will keep
        chilled for up to one day.

        Meanwhile, tip the jelly cubes into a heatproof bowl and pour over 100ml
        boiling water. Stir to dissolve, then add the raspberries and sugar and
        stir, crushing the berries with the spoon. Push through a sieve into a
        jug, then pour this over the set cheesecake. Chill for at least 4hrs.
        Will keep chilled for up to two days. Run a knife around the sides, then
        use the overhanging parchment to lift the cheesecake onto a board. Cut
        into squares.
